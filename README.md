# Fifty-two Programming Problems Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the programming problems from the book "Fifty-two programming problems" by Tamim Shariar Shubin.

## About

The book "Fifty-two programming problems" presents a collection of interesting programming challenges to help improve your coding skills. I've solved each problem using C/C++.

## Problems
1. ***Even Odd***
2. ***Even Odd - 1***

   ... (continue for all 52 problems)

## How to Use

You can navigate to each problem's folder to view the problem description and solution code.
